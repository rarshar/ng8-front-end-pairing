Perform the following exercises against the Angular 8 project provided alongside these instructions.
Before you begin, the files which require changing in order to finish these tasks are:
- app/app.component.html
- app/app.component.scss
- app/app.component.ts

The data for these tasks is located in:
app/Data/pokemon.ts
and is already imported into app.component.ts for you.

You're welcome to use Google and any other resources you'd like.


Tasks:
1. Currently, all pokemon names are being rendered to screen using the pokemon data available. 
Make the required changes so that the list looks similar to the reference image "pokemonLayout.png".

2. Underneath the All Pokemon list, render all Pokemon which have the "type" of "Grass".

3. In app.component.html, uncomment the "Create your own pokemon" section. 
Make the required changes so that it's possible to add your own pokemon with a type. 
This should allow you to add a pokemon with the type of "Grass" and have it appear in your list of pokemon from the previous task.

4. Provide the ability for a user to click on a pokemon tile and add it to a "favourites" list. Render the favourites list underneath the "Create your own pokemon section".

5. Write tests for the functions which have been created.

Don't forget:
npm install
ng serve
